PCBS : Effects of Noise Letters 

Replication of Effects of Noise Letters upon the Identification of A Target Letter in A Nonsearch Task, Eriksen & Eriksen published in 1974 in Perception & Psychophysics.

The goal of the study is to understand the effect of noise on the identification of a target. 
We will vary different parameters: the types of noise letters (response compatible or incompatible) flanking the target and the spacing between the letters in the display.
