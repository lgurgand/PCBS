# PCBS : Flanker Task


The Flanker Task is a task that measures cognitive control (which is the ability to ignore irrelevant thoughts or stimuli in order to do a task correctly), that was first published by Eriksen and Eriksen in 1974. The goal of the study is to understand the effect of noise on the identification of a target.

In the Flanker task, the subjects sees a line of arrows pointing to the left or to the right, and has to press a button indicating the direction of the middle arrow, which is flanked by other arrows which point in the same or opposite direction as the middle arrow.
The task is easier if the central arrow points in the same direction as the other ones (congruent condition <<<<<<), more difficult over wise because we have to make an effort to ignore the flanking arrows (incongruent condition <<<><<<).
Subjects are often slower and less accurate in the incongruent condition.

Be careful when running the code, make sure that your working directory is where the pictures are.

You can find a report of the analysis of the results (https://github.com/lgurgand/PCBS-Flanker-Task/blob/a867806e6ce80580d3b727652c902f746fb92606/PCBS_Flanker_task_ANALYSIS.pdf). The analysis were done using the software R. The experiment was done on 6 subjects, and 5 out of the 6 did show a significantely higher reaction time in the incongruent trials than in the congruent trials, as expected. 

I have mostly used R in the past and I had never used it to run experiments, only to analyze data. Thanks to this course, I have learned how to create experiments which can be very useful when working in cognitive science.
